.TH SPPCONFIG 8 "2017\-06\-19"
.SH NAME
sppconfig \- configure a SPP network interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "sppconfig [-v] [-a] [-s] interface"
.br
.B "sppconfig [-v] interface options | address ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Sppconfig
is a modification of ifconfig used to configure the kernel-resident Space Packet
Protocol network interface. It is used at boot time to set up the interface as
necessary.  After that, it is usually only needed when debugging or when system
tuning is needed.
.LP
If a single interface argument is given, it displays the status
of the given interface. Otherwise, it configures an interface.

.SH Address Families
SPP is the only address family supported by this tool. It is used for
decoding and displaying all protocol addresses.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a
display all interfaces which are currently available, even if down
.TP
.B -s
display a short list (like netstat -i)
.TP
.B -v
be more verbose for some error conditions
.TP
.B interface
The name of the interface.  This is usually a driver name followed by
a unit number, for example
.B slp0
for the first SLIP interface.
.TP
.B up
This flag causes the interface to be activated.  It is implicitly
specified if an address is assigned to the interface.
.TP
.B down
This flag causes the driver for this interface to be shut down.
.TP
.B "[\-]arp"
Enable or disable the use of the ARP protocol on this interface.
.TP
.B "mtu N"
This parameter sets the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of an interface.
.TP
.B "add addr"
Add an APID address to the interface.
.TP
.B "del addr"
Remove an APID address from the interface.
.TP
.B "media type"
Currently unimplemented.
Set the physical port or medium type to be used by the device.
The special medium type of
.B auto
can be used to tell the driver to auto-sense the media.
.TP
.B "[\-]pointopoint"
This keyword enables the
.B point-to-point
mode of an interface, meaning that it is a direct link between two
machines with nobody else listening on it. Sets or clears the
.B IFF_POINTOPOINT
flag for the interface.
.TP
.B txqueuelen length
Set the length of the transmit queue of the device. It is useful to set this
to small values for slower devices with a high latency (modem links, ISDN)
to prevent fast bulk transfers from disturbing interactive traffic like
telnet too much.
.SH NOTES
Since kernel release 2.2 there are no explicit interface statistics for
alias interfaces anymore. The statistics printed for the original address
are shared with all alias addresses on the same device. If you want per-address
statistics you should add explicit accounting
rules for the address using the
.BR iptables (8)
command.
.LP
Since net\-tools 1.60\-4 sppconfig is printing byte counters and human readable
counters with IEC 60027-2 units. So 1 KiB are 2^10 byte. Note, the numbers
are truncated to one decimal (which can by quite a large error if you
consider 0.1 PiB is 112.589.990.684.262 bytes :)
.LP
Interrupt problems with Ethernet device drivers fail with EAGAIN
.I (SIOCSIIFLAGS: Resource temporarily unavailable)
it is most likely a interrupt conflict. See
.I http://www.scyld.com/expert/irq\-conflict.html
for more information.
